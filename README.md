```lrc
[00:09.99] I've got all these things packed in my bag
[00:16.79] And what's inside here is a secret I won't share
[00:40.79] 
[00:25.72] They'd embarrass me so please don't ask
[00:32.44] If I were dying, they'd be personal effects
[00:53.94] 
[00:54.48] Stepping out today
[00:56.56] My bag it seems to weigh a lot
[01:00.44] But still I try to pay my way
[01:04.21] To far away
[01:09.71] 
[01:09.09] Half my body screams
[01:12.43] I always try my very best
[01:16.48] To bring you everything you'd want
[01:20.25] It may be for me
[01:28.25] 
[01:24.82] I'm into who you are
[01:28.61] I know it's true, oh so true
[01:33.23] Deep inside my heart
[01:36.59] No need to play, plead, explain
[01:52.09] 
[01:45.77] Pointless things just put strain on my back
[01:52.75] I'll pack regard for you down in my bag alone
[02:15.25] 
[02:01.44] If a car should hit me as I cross
[02:08.51] There'll be no keepsakes to embarrass me again
