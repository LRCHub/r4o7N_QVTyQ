I've got all these things packed in my bag
And what's inside here is a secret
I won't share
They'd embarrass me so please don't ask
If I were dying, they'd be personal effects
Stepping out today
My bag it seems to weigh a lot
But still I try to pay my way
To far away
Half my body screams
I always try my very best
To bring you everything you'd want
It may be for me
I'm into who you are
I know it's true, oh so true
Deep inside my heart
No need to play, plead, explain
Pointless things just put strain on my back
I'll pack regard for you down in my bag alone
If a car should hit me as I cross
There'll be no keepsakes to embarrass me again
